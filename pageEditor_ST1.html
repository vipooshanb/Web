                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p><b>HTML Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p> Used HTML techniques like meta refresh tag to redirect users to the Home page in 4 seconds. Used section and div tag to struture the content. Used h1 for the heading, p for the description. Used img tag to enter the image of the splash screen. implemented an Animated loader within a div tagto provide a visual cue for the users while they wait.</p>
                        <p><b>CSS Techniques:-</b></p>
                        <p>The CSS styles the Aqua Verse splash screen with modern, responsive design and animations. A global reset ensures consistency, and Flexbox centers content. The background uses a dimmed full-screen image. Keyframe animations like fadeIn, slideDown, bounce, and load create smooth transitions, a pulsating loader, and a dynamic progress bar. Typography and responsive layouts ensure the splash screen looks engaging across all devices.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The Aqua Verse splash screen uses semantic HTML for better accessibility, with headings, descriptive text, and alt attributes for images. An animated loader includes ARIA roles to support assistive technologies, while a meta refresh tag redirects users after 4 seconds. CSS ensures a responsive, high-contrast design with smooth animations and a prefers-reduced-motion option for users sensitive to movement, creating an engaging and accessible experience across all devices.</p>

                        <p>The HTML page structures a volunteer opportunities platform for “AquaVerse” using semantic elements and responsive design. It includes a hero section with headings, descriptions, and a call-to-action button. Volunteer programs are displayed as dynamic cards in a grid layout with images, ratings, and action buttons. Dropdown filters, a feedback form with emoji ratings, and a scrollable reviews section enhance interactivity. Font Awesome icons and external stylesheets are integrated for a modern and engaging user interface.</p> 
                        <p>CSS Techniques:- </p>
                        <p>This CSS design uses modern techniques like Google Fonts for clean typography, a global reset for consistency, and flexbox/grid for responsive layouts.

                <hr>    
                <p>
                    During the development of these web pages, we encountered several challenges that required collaborative problem-solving and adaptation. The primary hurdles involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Image Acquisition and Optimization:</b> Securing appropriate, high-quality images proved more time-consuming than initially anticipated. Finding images that accurately represented our content while remaining freely available for use (or acquiring the necessary licenses) required significant research and effort.  We primarily used Adobe Stock (or specify which Adobe service) for downloading images, but initial image downloads often resulted in overly large file sizes that negatively impacted page load speed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Resolution and Lessons Learned:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Image Optimization:</b> To address the image size issue, we implemented a multi-pronged approach.  We utilized CloudConvert to convert JPG and PNG images to the WebP format for improved compression and quality.  We also optimized images by resizing them to appropriate dimensions for their intended display size, and strategically compressed images using tools like TinyPNG and ImageOptim (or specify what you used if you used alternatives). The key lesson here was to prioritize image optimization from the outset of the project, rather than addressing it as an afterthought.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <hr>
                    <p>The webpages created adhere to JANET web publication regulationshas. Has a sematic HTML structure using section, h1, p , button. Has alt text for images. Consistent CSS for readability and visual hierarchy. Has a responsive design with flexbox and grid for different screen size adaption. Vaildated the HTML &CSS for comliance using W3C validation.</p> 

                    <p>We acknowledge that accessibility and compliance are ongoing processes. We are committed to continuously improving the accessibility and compliance of these web pages based on user feedback and evolving regulations.</p>
